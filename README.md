#Assignment-1 swapi. 
This is a simple showcase of fetching data from an api, in this case the Star Wars api- SWAPI: https://swapi.dev/documentation

I am rendering the first 5 items per record and have added categories to see different types of records. 

The images are stored locally as the SWAPI - data does not contain images. I have added pictures for each film and a generic star wars image that is added whenever there is no title or name match.
